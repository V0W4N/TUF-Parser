### FINALLY HERE IT IS!!!
Uses [TUF Api ](https://be.t21c.kro.kr)
# Instruction to use:
- You need [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- Also you need `requests` library installed aswell to pull data from the api
You can do that by doing the following steps:
1) Open cmd.exe (or your OS equivalent)
2) Type in `pip install requests`
3) Wait for loading
4) Done
- Navigate to `Releases` on the right panel and select the latest one
- Download `Source code.zip` (don't be afraid you won't deal with actual code)
- Extract to folder with general access (Desktop for example, needed for saving the chart and pass data into files)
- Locate the `client.py` file, doubleclick it and select `python.exe` from the folder where your python is installed

Terminal window will appear and a GUI with it
Other things are named accordingly and dont need explanation
Enjoy!
